It's a package to manage an mtg collection (and more?), well it's the aim at least don't know how much I will do.

Help is always welcome.

Don't know how it will be done, a special mode or something based on org-mode probably.

* TODO Make a true README not a TODO list
* TODO Add doc in the .el file
* TODO Add CI
* TODO Add Tests
* TODO Communicate with an API to get the cards (scryfall probably)
* TODO A mode to display a card and its info
** TODO Display its picture
** TODO Display its text (edition, mana cost...)
** TODO Display its price
** TODO Display the number owned
** TODO Edit the number owned
** TODO Edit owned card info (state, location, language, foil and more?)
* TODO A mode to display a set
** Display cards name or picture list in order
** Edit the number of cards owned and their info
* TODO A mode to display an arbitrary list of cards (collection, deck or search result)
